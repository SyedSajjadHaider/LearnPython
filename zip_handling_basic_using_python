for file in list_files:
    if file.lower().endswith(".zip") and zipfile.is_zipfile(file):
        print(" Name:",file)
# issue :-  suppose a image file is renamed with extension with .zip then this program will fail 
#           but if i use zipfile.is_zipfile(file) is_zipfile method then it can detect its fake or not 
#           another issue is that it return true for file xlsx , docx etc...
